# Summary

This is a private repository that allows a user of Axway's

product to extend its functionality. You are only granted read-only access to this repository.
Changes must be submitted via pull-requests for review and approval by an Axway employee.

## API Linting

If your organization has the
[API Compliance](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/amplify-central/page/docs/manage_compliance/index.html)
